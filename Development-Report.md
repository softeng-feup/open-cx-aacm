## Product Vision
 For the participants of the conference who want to take the best profit of the event the LiveFeedback app is a strong ally that provides the opportunity of interacting at any time of the talks by using a real time forum in which any attendee can give feedback, share and search the material used during each talk, ask questions, which you can do anonymously to make yourself comfortable for asking anything at all and also read other's questions.
 
 Unlike other common apps, our product helps not only the attendees but also the speakers because it gives you the chance to consult or answer the questions that weren't answered during the time of the talk afterwards.

---
## Elevator Pitch
 LiveFeedback solves the problem of having to wait until the end of the talks to ask your questions, risking forgetting them or even not asking them because it had to be in front of everybody, by using an online forum to help the attendees to ask their questions, that can be anonynous, share material and give feddback, all of this in real time during any talk. 

---
## Requirements

In this section, you should describe all kinds of requirements for your module: functional and non-functional requirements.

Start by contextualizing your module, describing the main concepts, terms, roles, scope and boundaries of the application domain addressed by the project.

### User stories
This section contains the requirements of the product described as **user stories**, organized in a global **user story map** with **user roles** or **themes**.

[User stories in trello](https://trello.com/b/ROideknb)


### Domain model

To better understand the context of the software system, it is very useful to have a simple UML class diagram with all the key concepts (names, attributes) and relationships involved of the problem domain addressed by your module.

## Architecture and Design

The Feedback app starts with a main page that redirect automatically the user to the login page. 
After the login, the homepage of the user allows to access the foruns of lectures that user attends. 
Each forum is associated to a lecture and can redirect user to three topics: resources, forum of answers and questions and feedback page.
Resources page allows every user (speaker and participant) to consult available resources and the speaker to share more resources.
In Q&A page, users can create a new topic and ask questions; the speaker, can create or delete a topic and answer questions.
Feedback page allows participants to add a new topic and every user to consult an existing one. 


### Logical architecture
The purpose of this subsection is to document the high-level logical structure of the code, using a UML diagram with logical packages, without the worry of allocating to components, processes or machines.
As the many levels of logic viewing requires, these are some of the high-level structures of LiveFeedback¬¥s code. This way we can prevent and assure key features of our service.

Log In Case Diagram shows how the app handles misused loggin information or non-existent loggin information.  
![LogInCase](https://github.com/softeng-feup/open-cx-aacm/blob/master/LogIn%20Case%20Diagram.png)

Ask Questions Case Diagram makes sure that the user inputs the question acoording to our restriction os number of characters.  
![AskQuestionCase](https://github.com/softeng-feup/open-cx-aacm/blob/master/AskQuestion%20Case%20Diagram.png)

Get Resources Case Diagram checks if the Resource number requested exists and if so presents it to the user.  
![GetResourceCase](https://github.com/softeng-feup/open-cx-aacm/blob/master/GetResources%20Diagram.png)

It can be beneficial to present the system both in a horizontal or vertical decomposition:
* horizontal decomposition may define layers and implementation concepts, such as the user interface, business logic and concepts; 
* vertical decomposition can define a hierarchy of subsystems that cover all layers of implementation.

### Physical architecture
The goal of this subsection is to document the high-level physical structure of the software system (machines, connections, software components installed, and their dependencies) using UML deployment diagrams or component diagrams (separate or integrated), showing the physical structure of the system.

It should describe also the technologies considered and justify the selections made. Examples of technologies relevant for openCX are, for example, frameworks for mobile applications (Flutter vs ReactNative vs ...), languages to program with microbit, and communication with things (beacons, sensors, etc.).

### Prototype
To help on validating all the architectural, design and technological decisions made, we usually implement a vertical prototype, a thin vertical slice of the system.

In this subsection please describe in more detail which, and how, user(s) story(ies) were implemented.

## Implementation
During implementation, while not necessary, it 

It might be also useful to explain a few aspects of the code that have the greatest potential to confuse software engineers about how it works. 

Since the code should speak by itself, try to keep this section as short and simple as possible.

Use cross-links to the code repository and only embed real fragments of code when strictly needed, since they tend to become outdated very soon.

---
## Test

To assure the quality of our application, we will run some tests.

We are planning to test the following features:
 * Sign in
        * Check the input data and its validity.
 * Add doubt
        * Check that the question is added to the forum and that it is displayed correctly.
 * Answer doubt
       * If speaker: 
                * Check that, when answering a question, the reply is highlighted to distinguish it from the other users.
       * If speaker/user: 
                * Check that the reply is added and displayed correctly.
  
There are several ways of documenting testing activities, and quality assurance in general, being the most common: a strategy, a plan, test case specifications, and test checklists.

In this section it is only expected to include the following:
* test plan describing the list of features to be tested and the testing methods and tools;
* test case specifications to verify the functionalities, using unit tests and acceptance tests.
 
A good practice is to simplify this, avoiding repetitions, and automating the testing actions as much as possible.

## Configuration and change management

Configuration and change management are key activities to control change to, and maintain the integrity of, a project‚Äôs artifacts (code, models, documents).

For the purpose of ESOF, we will use a very simple approach, just to manage feature requests, bug fixes, and improvements, using GitHub issues and following the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).


---

## Project management

Software project management is an art and science of planning and leading software projects, in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored and controlled. With that in mind, we decided to adopt a project management tool capable of registering tasks, assign tasks to people, add estimations to tasks, monitor tasks progress, and therefore being able to track our projects.
